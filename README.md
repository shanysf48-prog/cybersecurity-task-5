# cybersecurity-task-5
This repository contains Task 5 of my Cyber Security Internship, focusing on capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark. The project demonstrates packet capture, protocol filtering, and identification of TCP, UDP, DNS, and HTTP traffic, along with a detailed report and .pcap file.
# Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## 📌 Objective
To capture live network traffic and identify basic protocols using Wireshark.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark

## 📂 Task Performed
1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Started capturing packets on active network interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers.
4. Stopped capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied protocol filters (TCP, UDP, DNS).
6. Identified different protocols.
7. Exported capture as .pcap file.

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
- TCP
- UDP
- DNS
- HTTP

## 📊 Findings
- Observed TCP 3-way handshake.
- DNS query and response packets.
- HTTP request and response packets.
- Source and destination IP addresses.

## 📁 Deliverables
- Packet Capture File (.pcap)
- Internship Report (PDF)
- Screenshots

## 🎯 Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in packet capture, protocol analysis, and network troubleshooting.
